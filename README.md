# 🐱‍👤🐱‍👤 Polygon Naming Service 🐱‍👤🐱‍👤

Imagine, if a user wants to receive cryptocurrency in a wallet, then they have to provide a large id or public wallet address which comprises letters and numbers and is not easy to remember. ENS is what helps to resolve the issue and make remembering these a work of the past. ENS assigns a universal name or ID to the user which can be used across the decentralized blockchain platform instead of entering an unreadable combination of letters and numbers. These usernames are based on the Web 3.0 platform and can be commonly used on all blockchain and decentralized apps, instead of creating a complex and unique username for each. Not only websites, and digital wallets, but these unique ENS can also be used on metadata, smart contracts, and more.

This is my attempt to make a mini-ENS but on polygon.

## How are ENS created?
ENS domain name uses ERC-721 NFTs, which represent a unique address. It is understandable as NFTs are always unique and can never be duplicated. Now a user can either buy a domain or sell and transfer the NFT to trade a domain name. Since the wallet address and other details of the user are attached to the Token, it is only manageable by the owner and no one else has access to the same. A user will have to interact with the registrar for the subdomain they want.
